This solution and projects use an API, so you will need to ensure that the Beverage-Buddy.Data project is running
in order for the Beverage-Buddy.Web to be able to access the data, as the API resides in Beverage-Buddy.Data.

Here are the steps to configure it.
1.	Right click on the Solution name 'beverage-buddy'
2.	Select the Set Startup Projects... option
3.	In here click on the dropdown next to the Beverage-Buddy.Data and select Start
4.	Next click on the dropdown next to Beverage-Buddy.Web and select Start
5.	Click on Apply

This will then show <Multipe Startup Projects> in the Startup dropdown next to Start. When clicking start
this will then start up the Beverage-Buddy.Data project and then the Beverage-Buddy.Web project.
